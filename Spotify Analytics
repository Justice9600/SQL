# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle and created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# I then performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I used SQL to answer different questions someone may want to know about the data. 

#1. List the top 10 songs and their artist based on popularity.

SELECT artist_name,track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY popularity desc 
LIMIT 10;


#2.Which songs have a popularity score above 90?

SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
where popularity >89;

#3.Based on each artists track name ratings what is the avg popularity, danceability, and energy of each artist?
SELECT artist_name,
avg(popularity), 
avg(danceability), 
avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name;

#4.Based on the track name popularity scores, which artist have an average popularity score aboce 90?


SELECT artist_name, avg(popularity) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
group by artist_name
HAVING AVG(popularity) >= 90;

#5. Calculate the average popularity for the artists i
n the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an 
average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their 
average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH AvgPop AS
(SELECT artist_name, 
avg(popularity)as average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata 
group by artist_name)
SELECT artist_name, 
average_popularity, 
'TOP STAR' AS tag 
FROM AvgPop
WHERE average_popularity >= 90;
