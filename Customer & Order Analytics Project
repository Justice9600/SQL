# In this SQL project I'm querying a database query that involves multiple tables. The objective is to analyze and quantify statistics related to customer and order data.

#1.How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT cust.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb 
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue, product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product,quantity,SUM(quantity)*price as revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales  
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product; 

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price) as avg_amount_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id 
WHERE feb.quantity > 2 
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8.List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%' 
GROUP BY product;

#9.How many of each type of headphone were sold in feburary?
SELECT product, sum(quantity) as total_sold
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product like '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product;

#10.Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? 

SELECT location, count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE location like '%New York%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP by location 
HAVING count(orderID)>=3;

#11.How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT product, sum(quantity) as total_sold
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product like '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product;

#12.What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
WHERE cust.order_id =  feb.orderID
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
/*OR*/
SELECT SUM(price*quantity)/ COUNT(acctnum) 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
WHERE cust.order_id =  feb.orderID
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#13.What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SELECT sum(quantity)/COUNT(acctnum) as avg_quantity
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
WHERE cust.order_id =  feb.orderID
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#14.What product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring total?

SELECT product, SUM(price*quantity) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
